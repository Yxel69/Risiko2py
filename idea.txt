Risiko2 was a game written to be played in doxbox. I am trying to modernize the Game by rewritting the code in c++ and making it available to the public. 
Developing the Game for a Web based Application is also possible.

Gameplay :
You play a fledling interplanetary empire, starting from your homeplanet you sent fleets outside to the great unkown. 
The Astonomists of your civilisation have already marked all viable canidates for colonisation. 
The GameÂ´s Main Screen consists of all Stars in a given sector marked by there number and a text input field at the bottom where you can give your fleet commands.
Each Planet you own will produce a given number of Ships per turn/year.
Turns are synchronized , each player has to end hi turn for the game to continue.
Once multiple players clash at a given System a Battle will commence, the defending player gains a advantage and the opposing fleets will be calculated against each other.
When more and more Fleets traverse the Void the Chance for Events increases : Supernovae, Time-Diallation for the Fleets or finding new Systems.
If multiple galaxys are what is wished for then they will be accessible by travelling through wormholes that connect the different galaxys.
